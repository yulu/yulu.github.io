>The discipline thats investigates program development. How can it be done more efficiently? What's the best way of doing program development? And how can you develop reliable programs? - *Tevfik Bultan, UCSB*

>How is the software engineering different from programming: programming is all about the create part of the software. And that software engineering is about the entire lifecycle. - *Margaret M. Burnett, Oregon State University*

>It's fundementally a venue-creating acitivity, it involves social processes. - *Wolfgang Emmerich, CEO at Zuhlke Engineering Ltd*

>Software engineering is the act of many people working together and putting together many versions of large and complex systems. -*Andreas Zeller, Saarland University*

>Why can't we just get that by sitting down and writing software? Well, you could if software was small and simple enough to be developed by one or two people together in a room. But software development now is distributed, involves teams of people with different backgrounds who have to communciate with each other. It also involves customers, clients, users. Software engineers have to work with hardware engineers, with domain experts and therefore, we can't simply sit down and start coding. - *Lionel Briand, University of Luxermbourg*

## Overview

### The Software Crisis
The software crisis in 60s is mainly caused by three reasons: 1) the increase demand of the softweare, 2) the increase of the complexity of the software and 3) the fact that development productivity growth cannot catch up with software complexity growth

The research done showed that software becomes too difficult to build. This is what led to the [NATO Software Engineering](http://homepages.cs.ncl.ac.uk/brian.randell/NATO/) in Jan 1968.

### Software Development
> Study has shown that on average professinal software engineers produce LOC/day *50-100*. Why only 50-100 for a whole day? Because coding is not the only activity. That's an very important point.

Tools help to close the gap between the growth of the complexity of software and the growth of the development productivity. The common tools used for productivity improvement includes: IDEs, version control and coverage & verification tools (quality assurance).

## Life Cycle Models

> *What is the software lifecycle?*
> 
> It's the sequence of decisions that determine the history of your software. There're many ways in which you can make the desicions. It is important to understand which models are good for which situations. Criticality, expected variability effects model choosing. We may even use multiple lifecycle models in a project.

### Traditional software phases

#### Requirement Engineering

#### Design

#### Implementation

#### Verification & Validation

#### Maintenance
