The book 'Design data intensive application' is a really poplular book recently years. Why? The reason is that it is really 'easy' for the young application software engineers to follow and get a glance of what **distributed**  world looks like. That is also the reason why I spend a generous amout of time to read this book. I mean read this book piece by piece, more than three times and really digest 

This is my second time to read this book. The last time I read was kind of a casual glance through and I gave up in the middle of the book. After reflected on my [learning strategy](), I come up kind of plan and methodology for me to really digest this book.
