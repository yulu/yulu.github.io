> The book 'Design Data Intensive Application' is a really popular book recently years. Why? The reason is that it is relatively 'easy' for the inexperience application software engineers to follow and get a glance of what distributed  world looks like. This is my second time to read this book. The first time reading was kind of a casual glance through and I gave up halfway. After I reflected on my [learning strategy](http://littlecheesecake.me/blog1/2022/04/25/effective-learning.html), I come up with a plan for me to read and digest this book.

> I will share the learning notes in a series of blogs. In each post, I will start with a brief [Chapter Summary](#chapter-summary), followed up a [Mind Map](#mind-map) that summarizes the main topics and its relations. The topics in the mind map are attached with a list of questions what can be answered by the knowledge in the book. The questions and answers are listed in plain text in the [Questions Summary](#questions-summary) section. In the [Highlighted Topics](#highlighted-topics) section, a few interesting topics in the chapter are picked up to explain in details. In the last [Extended Topics](#extended-topics) section, one or two topics that is not covered in detail in the book is briefly discussed and explored.

>This is the third post of the series.
