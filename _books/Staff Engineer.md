Tech Leads are the most common Staff archetype and lead one team or a cluster of teams in their approach and execution. They’re comfortable scoping complex tasks, coordinating their team towards solving them, and unblocking them along the way. Tech Leads often carry the team’s context and maintain many of the essential cross-team and cross-functional relationships necessary for the team’s success. They’re a close partner to the team’s product manager and the first person called when the roadmap needs to be shuffled.  ([Location 162](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08RMSHYGG&location=162))

 >[!note]
Most importantly, an organization needs roughly one Tech Lead for every eight engineers, making it far more common than other archetypes.  ([Location 173](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08RMSHYGG&location=173))

 >[!note]
Some companies push for Architects to remain deep in the codebase, and others set a clear expectation that Architects must not write code: both models work for some companies.  ([Location 190](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08RMSHYGG&location=190))

 >[!note]
The Solver is most common in companies that think of individuals, rather than teams, as the atomic unit of planning and ownership  ([Location 200](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08RMSHYGG&location=200))
**A strong team concept is one where ownership, work, and accountability are generally assigned to teams. Signs of a strong concept are sprints, story points, tracking tickets, SLAs, and goals. A weak team concept is one where most work is assigned to individuals, and work is driven primarily through interpersonal connections rather than process.**

You’re far more likely to change your company’s long-term trajectory by growing the engineers around you than through personal heroics. The best way to grow those around you is by creating an active practice of mentorship and sponsorship.  ([Location 265](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08RMSHYGG&location=265))

 >[!note]
If you haven’t read it already, Lara Hogan has written the canonical piece on the distinction between sponsorship and mentorship, What does sponsorship look like?  ([Location 270](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08RMSHYGG&location=270))
**Mentorship vs sponsorship**

The answer is, of course, that it might be! The three consistent advantages that generally come with a Staff-plus title are: allowing you to bypass informal gauges of seniority, facilitating access to “the room,” increase in current and career compensation.  ([Location 337](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08RMSHYGG&location=337))
**Why you want/need to be a staff plus engineer**

 - *“informal gauges of seniority.”*:: 论资排辈 
 >[!note]
The one consistent exception to this rule is that women and minorities often do find they spend significantly less time and energy, proving themselves once they attain a Staff-plus title. The title doesn’t unlock new abilities for them, but it does remove some of the weight they’d been carrying with them throughout their career.

You should write design documents for any project whose capabilities will be used by numerous future projects. You should also write design documents for projects that meaningfully impact your users. You should write a design document for any work taking more than a month of engineering time.  ([Location 576](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08RMSHYGG&location=576))

Most folks are better writers than they are editors. This means it’s usually harder to edit a group document into clear writing than to identify one author to write a clear document.

When you combine that lack of familiarity with your domain with limited time for the topic at hand, communication is a challenge.  ([Location 1199](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08RMSHYGG&location=1199))

Broad-scoped engineers create impact by working on vague, cross-organizational projects. They tend to accumulate a lot of context across many different domains and play a support role in many projects across the org. This shape of Staff-plus Engineer is most common on our product engineering teams.  ([Location 1889](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08RMSHYGG&location=1889))

Deep-scoped engineers tend to be subject-matter experts in a specific domain. They lead ambitious multi-year projects. This shape of Staff-plus Engineer can generally be found on our product infrastructure and systems teams.  ([Location 1891](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08RMSHYGG&location=1891))

 >[!note]
I think that’s an important criteria for Staff-plus Engineers in product: not to just build something that ships, but for it to roll out smoothly and continue to succeed and grow over time with as few regrettable choices as possible. There will always be corners cut and features descoped during product development, especially for new products. A Staff product engineer makes those product and technical choices deliberately, taking on various different user personas to make the best choice possible and documenting rough edges thoroughly for future engineers.  ([Location 2013](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08RMSHYGG&location=2013))

 >[!note]
Another aspect of building leverage as a product engineer is creating processes and systems to manage “product debt.” Folks often talk about “technical debt,” but equally important is the “product debt” caused by supporting old versions of your product, and much of the difficulty of product engineering at scale is related to managing product debt and product drift (that is, products that need to interoperate with each other moving in different directions) over time.  ([Location 2039](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08RMSHYGG&location=2039))
**I like the term - product debt. This is a genius summery of the problem that a product team that is running for a longer lifepsan is facing!**
