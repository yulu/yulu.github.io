## notes
故事是个好故事，但是杨向荣的翻译太差了，实在读不下去。

年度最佳的有利竞争者！写得真好，简单的故事能写得这么引人入胜，写作功力太强。感谢翻译者的失败，让我不得不读原版，才没有错过原著的魅力！

这并非是个波澜壮阔的故事，围绕着平凡的斯通纳失败的无奈的妥协的一生，有着各自残缺的人物一一登场，与他发生交集引出一个个让人唏嘘的故事。而在每个人物身上，我们都能看到一点自己的影子，因为作者写的就是人性啊。

### Chapter VI

It was later determined that Sloane had died sometime late Friday night or early Saturday morning, of causes that were obviously natural but never precisely determined, and had remained the whole weekend at the desk starting endlessly before him. 

And because he had no family or loved ones to mourn his passing, it was Stoner who wept when the casket was lowered, as if that weeping might reduce the loneliness of the last descent. Whether he wept for himself, for the part of his history and youth that went down to the earth, or whether for the poor thin figure that once kept the man he had loved, he did not know.
