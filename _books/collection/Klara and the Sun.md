Kazuo Ishiguro intended to write a story for children, but after adding the morality thoughts of IA and gene edit, it turned out to be a story for adults (as he shared how he came up this noval). It is an interesting story to read and leaves something for me to think about, however it lacks something to be a classic.

 >Her whole face seemed to overflow with kindness, and the same creases that usually created such a tense expression would refold into ones of humor and gentleness

 >Yes. Until recently, I didn’t think that humans could choose loneliness. That there were sometimes forces more powerful than the wish to avoid loneliness

 >Don’t worry, there’s room enough for us all. You won’t have to travel in the trunk.
