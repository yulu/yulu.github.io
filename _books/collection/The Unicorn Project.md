Maybe it’s because when friends do favors for friends, we don’t require them to open a ticket first.  ([Location 928](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=928))

 - *adjourn,*
 >[!note]
So, when this started happening to her project, she spent every evening for weeks rearchitecting her system so that people could quickly, easily, and safely make the changes they wanted.  ([Location 1030](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=1030))
**I like this little story about Maxine’s side project.
As an architect, you should define the structure of your code, set the standard, and provide examples and documentations, what you should not do is control very piece of the code in detail.
Contributions should be encouraged, but guided.**

 >[!note]
Maxine knows that agility is never free. Over time, without this type of investment, software often becomes more and more difficult to change.  ([Location 1033](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=1033))

 >[!note]
But in almost every other domain, especially when you have customers, change is a fact of life.  ([Location 1036](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=1036))

 >[!note]
People were able to do what they wanted without being dependent on scores of other people. This is what great architecture enables.  ([Location 1053](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=1053))

 - *dilithium*
 >[!note]
Maxine does not delight in the suffering of others, but watching the fireworks surrounding Phoenix is much more exciting than waiting for people to work on her tickets.  ([Location 1070](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=1070))

thoughtful capacity-planning exercise.  ([Location 1110](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=1110))
**We need to do capacity planning. SRE**

 >[!note]
“How many transactions per second are we expecting for product displays and orders? And how many transactions per second are the current builds capable of handling right now? That will tell us how many servers we need for the horizontally scalable portions, as well as how far we’re off for the vertically scaled components, like the database.”  ([Location 1113](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=1113))
**This is something that are from the architect’s vocabulary**

 >[!note]
Since when have you ever cared what people in authority think about you?  ([Location 1146](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=1146))
**This should be the attitude of an architect!!! Never care about the people in authority think about you!**

 - *Lieutenant Saavik expression,*

 - *abdicated*:: 退位 
 >[!note]
eighty-page document full of tabs.  ([Location 1237](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=1237))
**How to build a complicated system…
But sometimes this is important and useful. With extensive build support, engineer are spoiled sometimes and they do not really care about building infrastructure but only the features! They lose the ability to build something from scratch.**

 >[!note]
Just scanning the section headings makes her heart leap—they’re the painstakingly assembled Phoenix build instructions, complete with links to documents, license keys, step-by-step tutorials, and even links to a bunch of videos. One is titled “Getting your uberjar to run in our (very) crazy, screwed up production web cluster (8 min),” and another is “How to monitor your apps despite our Ops groups (12 min).”  ([Location 1237](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=1237))

 >[!note]
Best of all, there’s a link to a four-node virtual machine cluster with administrative access! That means Maxine will be able to do whatever she wants without having to fill out another service desk ticket!  ([Location 1241](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=1241))

 >[!note]
But she can definitely see the different personalities and tech stacks of the different teams working on Phoenix. She had no idea there were so many.  ([Location 1283](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=1283))

 >[!note]
Maxine isn’t usually a fan of rigid standardization, but she’s not a fan of everyone getting to choose whatever they fancy in the moment.  ([Location 1286](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=1286))

 >[!note]
Each decision is a commitment to support it for years or even decades—these are decisions that go far beyond just one team.  ([Location 1287](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=1287))

 >[!note]
Kurt? He’s not the sharpest knife in the drawer, which is why he’s stuck in QA. He’s also really nosy. Why do you ask?  ([Location 1305](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=1305))

 - *solidarity.*
 >[!note]
Everything is by committee. No one can make decisions, and implementing even the smallest thing seems to require consensus from everyone.  ([Location 1421](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=1421))
**The importance of bottom up!!!**

 >[!note]
“I want to build and maintain something for the long haul, instead of shipping the ‘feature of the day’ and dragging all this technical debt around.”  ([Location 1427](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=1427))

 >[!note]
You clearly don’t understand how this game works. We’re QA. We protect the organization from developers.  ([Location 1453](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=1453))
**OMG, is this really a QA directors' thought? I am scared of this out-dated engineering culture.**

 >[!note]

**QA, SRE and Devs need to have a common OKR - improve the effectiveness of the CI/CD pipeline**

 >[!note]
“He only cares about growing his union membership dues, not about what’s right for the business.  ([Location 1461](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=1461))

**Me as well as someone worked with csv for a very long time!!**

 >[!note]
“You have no idea,” Brent says, rolling his eyes. “Different problem every time, depending on who generated the file. The most common problems lately are zero-length files, or files with no rows in them. And it’s not just the pricing team—we have data problems like this all over the place.”  ([Location 1596](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=1596))
**We need a sophisticated csv parser program here!**

 >[!note]
The Phoenix rollout was more than just a spectacular outage … it was the most amazing example of production data loss Maxine has ever seen.  ([Location 1614](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=1614))

“You’d think we have thirty teams of ten people, with each team able to get things done independently. But at times, it’s like we have only one team of three hundred people … Or maybe three hundred teams of one. In either case, something is very wrong …  ([Location 1812](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=1812))

 >[!note]
“You should be able to create value by changing one file, one module, one service, one component, one API call, one container, one app, or whatever!  ([Location 1918](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=1918))
**Create value by changing one thing!**

 >[!note]
“Build responsibility moved from Dev to QA to interns. Tech giants like Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google, and Microsoft give Dev productivity responsibilities to only the most senior and experienced engineers. But here at Parts Unlimited, it’s the exact opposite.”  ([Location 1928](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=1928))

 >[!note]
“Sometimes it’s when simple components become complected, and you can no longer reason about it or change it without immense effort or risk of catastrophe. Sometimes it’s when decision-making processes or the organizational structure loses locality, forcing even small decisions to be escalated—your infamous ‘Square.’  ([Location 1937](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=1937))
**I like the word - locality!**

 >[!note]
“I’ve started calling all of these things ‘complexity debt,’ because they’re not just technical issues—they’re business issues. And it’s always a choice,”  ([Location 1940](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=1940))
**Tech debt and product debt, and biz debt!!! Are the team organized in an effective way? Are the processes optimized?**

 >[!note]
“You can choose to build new features or you can choose to pay down complexity debt. When a fool spends all their time on features, the inevitable outcome is that even easy tasks become difficult and take longer to execute. And no matter how hard you try or how many people you have, it eventually collapses under its own weight , forcing you to start over from scratch.”  ([Location 1941](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QT9QR41&location=1941))
