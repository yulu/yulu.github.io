Hi. I am <span>Yu Lu</span>, a software engineer and a mother based in Singapore.
<br><br>
Welcome to LittleCheeseCake, my personal corner of the internet where I share my thoughts, learnings, and experiences.

## What This Blog Is About

This blog covers three main areas:

**Technology** - As a software engineer, I write about programming, software development, and tech topics I'm exploring. From practical tutorials to reflections on the industry, I share what I learn along the way.

**Personal Life** - Travel adventures, book reviews, career reflections, and life as a working parent. These posts are a journal of my journey through life's various chapters.

**Personal Finance** - My exploration of financial independence, investing, and wealth management. I share educational content, tools, and insights from my own learning journey in personal finance.

## Why I Write

I started this blog as a way to document my learning journey and share knowledge with others who might find it useful. Writing helps me think more clearly and retain what I learn. If my posts help even one person along the way, that's a bonus.

## Who This Is For

Whether you're a fellow software engineer, someone interested in personal finance and FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early), or just curious about tech and life topics, I hope you find something valuable here.

## A Note on Content

All opinions expressed here are my own and based on personal research and experience. For financial topics, please see the <a href="/disclaimer/">disclaimer</a> - nothing here constitutes professional advice.
