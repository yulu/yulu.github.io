Hi. I am <span>Yu Lu</span>.<br>
<br>
LittleCheeseCake is my personal blog to share my learning experience and my thoughts. I am a Software Engineer, working on mobile/web applications. Here I am blogging about technologies - image and vision technologies, mobile platforms and product design, as well as little things happened in my life, things that confuse me, cheer me up, beat me down and drive me to grow.
