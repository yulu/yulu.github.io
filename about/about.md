LittleCheeseCake is my personal blog to share my learning and my thoughts. I am working on Internet product design and development, proficient in Android platform and exploring other fields as well. Here I am blogging about technologies that interests me - image and vision technologies, mobile products, coding and design, as well as little things happened in my life, things that confuse me, cheer me up, beat me down and drive me to grow.
