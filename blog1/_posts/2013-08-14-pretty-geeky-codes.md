Haven't been here writing about techqies for such a long time. During the past few months, I had a wonderful backpack trip to Europe, where I met the Taiwanese guy who is writing shaders for Disney Animation - my dream job! Through the blog, I also made friends with a few freelance app designers and entrepreneurs in Singapore, and was given the chance to talk to [media in China](http://www.geekpark.net/read/view/185730) and tech-book author in Europe. On the other hand, thanks to my best friend, who is going to start an online business targeting Singapore market, I made money from my paintings for the very first time. These are great opportunities for me to grow, which made me step just a little bit closer to my dream career.

Recently I came across an article about Photoshop tricks for image color adjustment, which lead me to some very interesting chapters in the book [GPU Gem 2](http://http.developer.nvidia.com/GPUGems2/gpugems2_part01.html). Feel the urge to write something down about these - I just cannot stop my passion for pretty images created from pretty geeky codes - GPU codes are just pretty.

Another interesting find-out is the [interactive-book](http://pixelshaders.com/) for pixel shaders! The author is the type of person I really admire - who is enthusiastic about tech and art, and made coof stuffs to demonstrate the combination of the two. On the site, the real-time interaction using WebGL makes shader programming so fast and easy. I cannot wait to test some of my camera filters on the site. Suggested by lots of friends, I am considering writing a few really beautiful and cool filters for the camera app and add in-app purchase function - maybe it is the time for me to try whether this little hobby is able to provide me bread and butter.

Cheer up and keep working!!
