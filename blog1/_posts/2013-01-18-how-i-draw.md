Share the process I adopt to draw on iPad.

First I'd like to have a rough sketch on the paper. Only pen can provide such flexibility for free drawing.

Then I take a picture of the sketch, and load it to the drawing app (what I use is sketchbook pro). Add a new layer and trace the outline. Note that sketchbook brush could not provide such smooth tips at the end of the lines. I have to use eraser to make that kind of natural effects.

Now add colors. Blend large chunks of colors first and add the shades and details on that. So that's it, a simple drawing on iPad.

And if I erase the outline and refine the colors a bit more, I got more romantic and soft style for the painting. I just like this more.
