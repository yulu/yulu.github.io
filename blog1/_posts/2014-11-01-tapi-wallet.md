[TapiWallet](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tapidata.tapi) is the Android App for customer e-receipt services provided by TapiData Inc, a startup company incubated in NUS. As exectutive app developer for the project, I took responsibility of all the mobile-related product design and development practices.

Now I have officially left the company, but the startup exprience and the design and programming skills I gained are most valuable to me.
