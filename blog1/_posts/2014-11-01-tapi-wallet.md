[TapiWallet](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tapidata.tapi) is an Android App for e-receipt services provided by TapiData Inc, a startup company incubated in NUS. As exectutive app developer for the project, I took responsibility of all the mobile-related product design and development practices. 

TapiData provide a solution to replace the paper receipt with e-receipt. It takes advantages of the NFC technology of smartphone, to capture the digital information of the receipt from the printer and display on user's mobile device. 
TapiWallet app together with its web services provide a solution of user behavior analysis and product recommendation based on the data capture from users' e-receipt.

The overall visual design and the fully-impelementation on Android platform is done by me:

Now I have officially left the company, but the startup exprience and the design and programming skills I gained are most valuable to me. The main contributions I've made to this project:

- Took responsibility for software development lifecycle of TapiWallet app, including software architecture design, API design, UI/UX design, test, deployment, maintenance and documentation preparation.

- Improved product features: improved membership point redemption procedure by introducing animated page design / extended the compatibility of the application to lower version of its dependency
