Accidently found a YouTube video of [Dr David Chen](http://www.stanford.edu/~dmchen/)'s defence presentation when searching for his paper (and realized I followed his tutorial to study server-client image processing on Android a year ago). It is such an excellent presentation with very clear explaination of the classic computer vision and visual search algorithms such as SIFT and Hierarchy Vocabulary Tree, and advanced mobile (on-device) visual search algorithms. Despite of his stunningly impressive resume and his 7 years post-grad experience in the field, his PhD thesis is actually quite concise and specific. Then I found that I have already gained some of the mathematic tools, programming skills and the undertanding of the hardware devices in the related area, should not fear to try and practice in my research. Gain a lot both in the ideas of algorithm designs as well as academic presentation skills. Take a note.
