I decided to translate some posts in Chinese to English and keep a copy of those here. Some design logs I felt quite interesting and worth to be shared. Today share the process for design a simple logo.

A logo for AR Lab:

Step1: Brain storm among all the members, and ART (short for Augmented Reality Technology) is emphasized. We decided to abstract these three letters in the logo

Step2: Draw them Out! Try different transformations and colors. SketchBook Pro is a good choice for free sketch. Among the designs, pick a few to refine.

Step3: Vectorize the candidate designs in illustrator. Pick the one that is best suitable for requirement.

Step4: Add more effect and refinement using Photoshop if necessary.
